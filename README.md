The provided code represents a simple handwritten digit recognition model using a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset. It employs TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the model
It employs TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the model. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits, and the code preprocesses this data by normalizing the pixel values. The neural network architecture consists of a flattening layer followed by a dense hidden layer with ReLU activation and dropout to prevent overfitting. The output layer uses softmax activation to classify digits 0 to 9. After compiling and training the model, it is evaluated on a test dataset, and accuracy is reported. Finally, the code visualizes some test images, displaying both predicted and true labels, offering an intuitive view of the model's performance. This basic model serves as a starting point for digit recognition tasks, with potential for further enhancements using more advanced neural network architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
